"PAFMECA is founded in Mwanza, Tanganyika, at a small meeting of 22 representatives of political organisations. Delegates discuss the scope and aims of PAFMECA, with some disagreements about the involvement of Central African organisations and the desirability of a formal East African Federation. The only delegate representing a political party from the Central African Federation is Kanyama Chiume, for the Nyasaland African Congress.",September 1958,
"PAFMECA meets in Zanzibar and is credited with encouraging cooperation between the two main nationalist parties, the Zanzibar Nationalist Party and the Afro-Shirazi Party.",April 1959,
"Eventually, after the Ugandan colonial administration ban PAFMECA from meeting in the country, delegates meet in Moshi, Tanganyika. Among the delegates were individuals from Ruanda-Urundi and the Belgian Congo, and a notable woman delegate, Bibi Titi Mohamed, representing the Tanganyika African National Union. The central controversy at Moshi was whether the Kenya National Party, as an avowedly multiracial party, could be a PAFMECA member.",September 1959,
"At PAFMECA’s widest reaching meeting to date, arguably the peak of its activities, delegates meet in Addis Ababa. The Central African Federation is especially well represented, and PAFMECA votes to make Kenneth Kaunda’s UNIP ‘first priority’, supported through a Freedom Fund. The shift of the continental struggle towards liberation movements in Southern Africa is apparent at the Addis Ababa, and the organisation changes its name to reflect this.",February 1962,
"Following the founding of the Organisation of African Unity in May 1963, it is decided that PAFMECA’s continued existence is no longer necessary. Competition between regional pan-Africanisms seems to play a role in PAFMECA’s demise. Equally, PAFMECA’s permanent office, held together by Mbiyu Koinange in Dar es Salaam, is struggling to keep the spawling organisation running. There are attempts to revive PAFMECA in the years that follow, but ultimately its plans for a regular publication and radio broadcasts never materialise. Nevertheless, the contacts made between regional leaders remained important for decades to come, especially when political turbulence forced members into exile in neighbouring independent states.",May 1963,
