"The East African Community (EAC) was established in 1967, resulting from a treaty between Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania, replacing the previous East Africa Common Services Organisation. Headquartered in Arusha, Tanzania, its primary goal initially was the creation of a common market, and a uniform economy. It also planned to create an East African railway, port, airline, telegraph and postal service. The EAC also worked to create a regional education system, a shared higher education institution (the University of East Africa), and a publishing house (the East African Literature Bureau). Citizens could travel, seek employment, and reside across all three countries.",1967,
"Relations between Uganda and the rest of the EAC began to collapse, when Idi Amin seized power in January 1971. He overthrew the former president, Milton Obote, who, as a close friend of Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, fled into exile in Tanzania. Nyerere refused to recognise the new Ugandan government, and offered asylum to supporters of Obote.",1971,
"In the early 1970s, East African economic integration began to dissolve. In 1972, due to exchange controls and trade barriers, the East African monetary union was disbanded. In the following year, in 1973, restrictions were placed on intra-regional transfers of funds, which made it difficult for regional corporations to function. In 1974, the East African Income Tax Department was dissolved.",1972-1974,
"Even though relations between all three East African countries were deteriorating rapidly, the hopes for a united East Africa remained. In a speech to the East African Legislative Assembly in Arusha in January 1975, President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania implored his regional partners to “think East Africa”, and “to hold on to the realisation of [their] East Africanness.”",January 1975,
"Tensions between Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania reached their zenith, and in July 1977, after a decade of existence, the EAC collapsed. In the following year, Uganda invaded Tanzania in October 1978, beginning a war that would last eight months. The EAC was re-established nearly a quarter of a century later in July 2000.",July 1977,
