"PAFMECA was founded in Mwanza, Tanganyika, at a small meeting of 22 representatives of political organisations. Delegates discussed the scope and aims of PAFMECA, with some disagreements about the involvement of Central African organisations and the desirability of a formal East African Federation. The only delegate representing a political party from the Central African Federation was Kanyama Chiume, for the Nyasaland African Congress.",September 1958,
"PAFMECA met in Zanzibar and was credited with encouraging cooperation between the two main nationalist parties, the Zanzibar Nationalist Party and the Afro-Shirazi Party.",April 1959,
"Eventually, after the Ugandan colonial administration banned PAFMECA from meeting in the country, and delegates met in Moshi, Tanganyika. Among the delegates were individuals from Ruanda-Urundi and the Belgian Congo, and a notable woman delegate, Bibi Titi Mohamed, representing the Tanganyika African National Union. The central controversy at Moshi was whether the Kenya National Party, as an avowedly multiracial party, could be a PAFMECA member.",September 1959,
"At PAFMECA’s widest reaching meeting to date, arguably the peak of its activities, delegates met in Addis Ababa. The Central African Federation was especially well represented, and PAFMECA voted to make Kenneth Kaunda’s UNIP ‘first priority’, supported through a Freedom Fund. The shift of the continental struggle towards liberation movements in Southern Africa was apparent at the Addis Ababa, and the organisation changed its name to reflect this.",February 1962,
"Following the founding of the Organisation of African Unity in May 1963, it was decided that PAFMECA’s continued existence was no longer necessary. Competition between regional pan-Africanisms seemed to play a role in PAFMECA’s demise. Equally, PAFMECA’s permanent office, held together by Mbiyu Koinange in Dar es Salaam, was struggling to keep the spawling organisation running. There were attempts to revive PAFMECA in the years that follow, but ultimately its plans for a regular publication and radio broadcasts never materialised. Nevertheless, the contacts made between regional leaders remained important for decades to come, especially when political turbulence forced members into exile in neighbouring independent states.",May 1963,
