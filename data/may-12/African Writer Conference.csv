"Debates centred around the direction of African literature in an era when most African countries were gaining their independence. Questions included: What is African literature? Is it African literature by Black Africans, or literature by people living in Africa? What language should African literature be in? Who is the African writer writing for?",Debates,
"Enjoying Kampala’s nightlife was as much as part of the conference as the debates during the day were. The conference participants enjoyed getting to know the city’s bars and discotheques, in particular Top Life Nightclub, the most popular club in Kampala at the time. This was where Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o later recalled seeing Wole Soyinka dancing the cha-cha-cha to a very impressed audience of fellow dancers.",Nightlife,
"Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o (then James Ngugi) was an undergraduate student of English at Makerere College at the time, and was one of the few student participants in the conference. When he heard Chinua Achebe would be present, one evening he knocked on Achebe’s door, holding the manuscript for his debut novel, Weep Not, Child, in his hands. Achebe agreed to read it, and was so impressed, he showed to the publishing company Heinemann, and it was later published in the African Writers Series. This was the beginning of Ngũgĩ’s career as East Africa’s most celebrated writer. ",Chinua Achebe and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o,
