"Around the same time that Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika gained independence, Makerere College, University College Nairobi, and University College Dar es Salaam merged to become sister colleges of the University of East Africa. They would coordinate and distribute activities according to expertise, as a means to manage relatively limited funds.",June 1963,
"As Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania had all gained independence, academics began to discuss the Africanisation of the curriculum across the University of East Africa. At the Seminar on the Role of the University in November 1965, attended by East African politicians and academics, it was agreed that political independence should be reflected in independence of thought and scholarship in higher education. The requirement to move away from a Eurocentric syllabus was widely recognised, as well as the Africanisation of academic staff , who were still dominated by European expatriates across all three colleges.",November 1965,
"Students of the University of East Africa at Makerere, University College Nairobi and University College Dar es Salaam embraced the spirit of pan-East Africanism with fervour. For example, in October 1966, students at University College Dar es Salaam protested against the mandatory National Service introduced by President Julius Nyerere. Students at Makerere College protested in solidarity with their Tanzanian counterparts, sending a Makerere Students Guild delegation to Nyerere to plead for amnesty for the 300 students he had suspended from University College Dar es Salaam.",October 1966,
"Uncertainty of the future of the University of East Africa was becoming increasingly prominent. The first University Development Plan focused on activities until 1967, with future planning remaining dependent on regional economies. This meant that the University of East Africa could dissolve after 1967, an assumption that could not be confirmed. At a University Council meeting in September 1968, the Vice-Chancellor vocalised his criticism of this uncertainty, and the effects this was having on university staff. Eventually it was decided to extend the life of the University of East Africa until 1970.",1967-68,
"The uncertainty continued to loom over the future of the University of East Africa, and it became increasingly difficult for inter-collegiate administration to remain coordinated. For example, in the academic year 1969/1970, all three colleges had different term start and end dates. This made it difficult for students in East Africa to pursue higher education in a sister country, as the dates of an institution in one country, were not aligned with an institution in their home country. However, it was impossible to adjust term dates, as this would mean the governments of two of the countries would have to change their financial year to correspond with the university calendar. This is just one example how administrative issues continued to plague the University of East Africa.",1969,
"The rise of political authoritarianism in Uganda and Kenya meant that these countries were becoming increasingly introverted, causing a breakdown in East African regionalism. The University of East Africa was eventually dissolved, with the individual colleges becoming Makerere University, University of Nairobi and University of Dar es Salaam. However, informal links between the institutions remained, and the University of Nairobi became a haven for Makerere academics fleeing Idi Aminâ€™s Uganda.",1970,
