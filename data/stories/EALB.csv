"As the Second World War neared its end and officials began to focus on planning for post-war developments, discussions intensified around establishing a Literature Bureau for East Africa to co-ordinate the publishing of literature and textbooks. Though in Tanganyika some argued that given the urgent need for more publications, it would be better to start with a Tanganyika Literature Bureau which could be absorbed into a wider regional body as and when it was set up.",1944-1945,
The East African Literature Bureau (EALB) was established under the auspices of the East African High Commission and largely financed from the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund. Charles Granston Richards served as Director.,1948,
The EALB was transferred to the East African Common Services Organisation when it replaced the East African High Commission.,1961,
"Charles Granston Richards stepped down as Director of the EALB. Jonathan Kariara served as acting Director, then Noah Sempira.",1963,
"The EALB’s colonial roots were a source of concern to East Africa’s post-independence leaders. Speaking in the East African Central Legislative Assembly Pio Gama Pinto said: ‘If we go through the list of books which have been published, we know this, that a number of them deal with subjects which tend to praise colonial rule… I think the time has come now for the East African Literature Bureau to provide an outlet for the writings of promising young African writers, but I do not see that this can take place easily unless the medium whereby these books could be published, or the special committee which is appointed, is sympathetic to the writers whose subjects will appeal to readers or to the masses in East Africa.’",1964,
"At the signing of a new book distribution agreement, the Deputy Secretary-General of the East African Community (EAC), Mr Joseph Muchemi noted the expansion of the Bureau’s publishing activities and that ‘more and more new and established East African authors were coming to the Bureau with their books for publication.’",1969,
"The EALB continued to expand its range of publications. In 1973 they began publishing Umma, a new literary journal by the Literature Department at the University of Dar es Salaam, which they published alongside literary journals from Makerere and Nairobi, and which brought to more than 10 the number of journals they published",1973,
"With relations between members of the East African Community under strain, the question of what would happen to the EALB and what would replace it in the case of the EAC’s collapse was intensively discussed.",1977,
"The collapse of the EAC had consequences for potential publishers. Kimani wa Njigu, of Othaya Boys Secondary School, wrote to the Daily Nation to ask what had happened to his manuscript which he’d sent to the Bureau in December 1976. The newspaper informed him that ‘Mr. Mohamed Ismail of the Bureau, says since the death of the East African Community, “a lot of re- adjustments” had to be carried out and the work at the Bureau could not be carried out smoothly.’",1978,
